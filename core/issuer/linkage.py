"""Multiple-identity detection (spec Feature 4): does this credential's
biometric reference also appear on a DIFFERENT registry record?

Deliberately a registry cross-reference, not a face-similarity computation
-- portrait_reference is a synthetic symbolic cluster label (see
core/issuer/models.py), never a real embedding, so there is no similarity
score to report and none is fabricated. Wording stays at "possible
linkage detected", never a certainty claim -- see core/risk.py's
_DECISIVE_TIERS, which Tier.IDENTITY is deliberately NOT a member of:
this can raise a case for review, it can never condemn one alone.
