"""Canonical manifest: sign the document's portrait and MRZ pixel hashes
at intake, verify them later. Simplified from full ICAO Passive
Authentication (which hashes every data group on a chip) to exactly two
hashes, but the cryptographic property is the same one PA provides: proof
that specific data has not changed since a trusted authority attested to
it.

What this legitimately proves vs does not, stated precisely because it
matters for the demo narrative:

  PROVES: the portrait and MRZ pixels in the presented image are
  byte-identical to what was signed at intake -- i.e. nothing has altered
  OUR OWN STORED RECORD since we captured and signed it. This is the
  injection-attack defence (docs/01-RESEARCH.md): if an attacker
  substitutes an image after our system attested to the original, the
  hash mismatch is immediate and needs no model.

  DOES NOT PROVE: that the original capture itself was a genuine document
  rather than, say, a photograph of a screen. A screen recapture gets
  signed too, faithfully, at the moment it is captured -- there is nothing
  for a hash check to disagree with, because nothing has been altered
  SINCE that signature was made. That is exactly why
  core/forensics/recapture.py exists as an independent signal: cryptography
  answers "has this record been tampered with since intake", not
  "was intake itself trustworthy". Conflating the two would be dishonest.

This is why the pipeline offers two distinct verification modes:
  - self-consistency: sign the presented image, then immediately verify
    it against that same signature. Used for attacks that alter the
    ORIGINAL capture (DOB edit, screen recapture) -- crypto correctly
    stays silent; the tier built to catch each of those (crosszone,
    forensics) is the one that fires.
  - impersonation: verify a presented image against a DIFFERENT, earlier
    signature -- simulating an attacker substituting a photo on what is
    presented as a previously-issued, already-signed record. Used for the
    portrait-swap attack, which is precisely that scenario.
