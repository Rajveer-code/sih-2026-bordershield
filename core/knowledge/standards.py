"""Curated, honestly-sourced explanations for why each check exists --
deliberately NOT a retrieval/RAG pipeline: no embeddings, no vector
store, nothing "retrieved" at runtime. A judge's "why is this required?"
deserves either a real, checkable source or an honest "this is our own
policy, not an external standard" -- never an invented citation.

Where the source is an external standard (ICAO Doc 9303), only claims
verifiable at the PART level are made here. This build does not assert
exact clause/section numbers, which would need a copy of the primary
document on hand to verify precisely -- claiming that precision without
it would be exactly the kind of fabricated citation this module exists
to avoid. Anything specific to how BorderShield itself works (weights,
thresholds, the synthetic registry) is cited to this repo's own files,
which are 100% checkable by construction.

The deterministic validators (core/rules/, core/issuer/, core/forensics/,
core/crypto/) remain solely responsible for actual validation -- nothing
here influences a verdict; this is explanation only.
