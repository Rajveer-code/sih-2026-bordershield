"""Hash-chained, append-only event log: the PS's own "digital trail for
investigations and intelligence analysis" bullet, delivered cryptographically
rather than as a database table someone could quietly edit.

Deliberately NOT a blockchain network, and no PII is ever written here --
see docs/02-STRATEGY.md Thesis 4. Each record stores only a decision, a
digest of its inputs, and metadata.

Two independent guarantees, kept as two functions rather than one, because
they defend against two different attacks:

  verify_chain()          editing any record IN PLACE breaks every hash
                           after it, and names exactly where. Does NOT
                           detect deletion -- a truncated file is fully
                           self-consistent, since nothing after the cut
                           exists to contradict it.

  verify_no_truncation()  catches exactly that gap. append() signs a
                           small {record_count, tail_hash} checkpoint with
                           the same demo signing authority core/crypto/pki.py
                           mints for documents, every time it writes a
                           record. A file with fewer records than the last
                           signed checkpoint claims -- or the right count
                           but a different tail -- can only mean someone
                           deleted the most recent record(s) since that
                           checkpoint was written; producing a checkpoint
                           that agrees with a shorter file requires the
                           signing authority's private key, which a file-
                           level edit does not have.

Both together are still a local hash-chain, not a distributed ledger: an
attacker with the demo signing key AND write access to both files can
regenerate a fully self-consistent shorter chain. That's an honest
boundary of what one local signing authority can attest to on its own,
not a gap in these two functions -- see docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md's note on
a periodic external anchor for closing it further.
