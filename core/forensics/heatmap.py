"""Evidence overlay: box the exact region each FAILED signal is about,
directly on the document image. This is the difference between "the AI
says this is fake" and "the AI found this exact problem" -- see
docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md, which calls this a must-have for exactly that
reason.

Most detectors don't carry their own bounding box in Signal.detail --
they don't need to, because the regions in question are already known
constants (core/fields.py knows exactly where the portrait and MRZ band
are; core/crosszone.py's check names already encode which VIZ field they
compared). Mapping check name -> region here, rather than pushing a bbox
into every detector's return value, keeps the detectors themselves
free of a UI concern -- correctness of a signal and where to draw it are
different questions.
