"""Cross-document consistency: compares fields extracted from TWO
separately-screened real documents (e.g. a passport and a marksheet).
This is the actual mechanism behind "how do you verify a DOB without a
government database": if two independently-issued documents for the
same person both carry a date of birth, and it agrees, that is real
corroborating evidence -- no registry required. If it disagrees, that is
a real finding, worth exactly as much scrutiny as any other cross-field
mismatch this codebase already reports.

Deliberately opt-in and additive: core/realdoc/pipeline.py::screen_real_document
is unchanged and still screens exactly one document. This module composes
TWO of its independent results after the fact, reusing the same Signal/
Severity/Tier vocabulary and the same core/realdoc/risk.py::fuse_realdoc
re-fusion, rather than threading a second document through the tested
single-document path.
