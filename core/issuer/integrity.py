"""Registry integrity: per-record fingerprints + a signed aggregate
manifest, reusing the SAME demo signing authority core/crypto/pki.py
already mints for documents -- one authority attesting both.

Deliberately not per-record ECDSA signatures. Each record's
`issuer_signature` is a sha256 fingerprint of its own canonical fields --
cheap, key-independent, identical on every machine. The manifest
aggregates those fingerprints into one sha256 ("aggregate_sha256", a
simplified Merkle-root stand-in: sorted-fingerprint concatenation, not a
full tree) and THAT is what gets ECDSA-signed. Flipping a status in place
(e.g. REVOKED -> ACTIVE) changes that row's fingerprint and the aggregate
hash, so core/issuer/registry.py::verify_integrity() catches it without a
real Merkle tree.

Why the manifest is never committed to git: data/pki/'s keys are
per-machine and non-deterministic (core/crypto/pki.py::generate_csca has
no seed) -- a manifest signed on one machine would fail signature-chain
verification against a DIFFERENT machine's freshly-generated CSCA. Signing
lazily, on whatever PKI already exists (or gets lazily created) on the
machine that's actually running, keeps the mint and the verify always
talking to the same authority -- see load_or_create_pki's own docstring
for the identical reasoning applied to documents.
